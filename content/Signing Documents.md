Recently, I've been in the positions where I have to sign documents that actually require me to read them. Just to save time, I use a *trick* to lessen my reading-burden.

I ask a rather playful question to the document giver and make them explain the document to me. I go for the worst case scenario of how the agreement could be used against me if I fail the knowingly or unknowingly go against the terms of the document.

Example:

Document Giver: *Hands me a document*

Me: Is this trying to say that you guys are allowed to charge me $20k if something goes wrong?

DG: *Goes on to yap about the fine details of the document*

Of course, this is not a good strategy for every case where you have to sign something, but It's been helpful to me in some cases.
