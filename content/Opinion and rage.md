Growing up, I always observed people who stayed at newspaper stands to argue and cuss other people. "Why are they so mean to each other" was usually the question ringing in my mind.  
  
Now I get it. Twitter made me understand. You easily get enraged when you constantly read opinion. It's worse now because more opinions are in your face every second, and it's really the ones you disagree with.  
  
The same way people were mean in the newspaper stands, is how people argue to death on Twitter. You read opinion and you are immediately forced to have an opinion on that opinion.  
  
The constant need to have a "side". I wonder if people don't see how it's rots their brain. They're force to have opinions even on things that are irrelevant to them. You read something on say, "Transgender policies in sports" and immediately flare up. You ever asked yourself. What's my business with this? Does this concern me? Will this affect me now or in the future?  
  
The less you react, the better you'll feel.
