I always find it awkward when people say "We've lost the art of X," Where X is a seemingly good thing that functioned well in the past. Instances of this could be dating, hard work, romance etc.

I find that these types of people think that something was "very good" in the past and we need to bring back whatever version of it existed back then. I think they're wrong and are naively talking about a very narrow or one sided picture of whatever romanticized version of X they're clinging to. 

I think most of the human problems that exist now, also existed back then. I also think that the things they criticize as present day problems aren't new problems. We didn't lose anything. The good that you feel is lost still exist. We just live in a very large information bubble and get bombarded with so much stuff. Most of us have chosen to focus on the negative information. I think that negative information also sells more and generates more reaction. Due to all this, we begin to see the world through a single lens and begin to claim it as the default. This is why we think that supposedly "good things" have been lost.
