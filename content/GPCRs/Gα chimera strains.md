- Gα chimera strains are genetically engineered cells or organisms that express a hybrid G protein subunit composed of portions from two or more different Gα subunits. These chimeric Gα subunits are created by exchanging specific regions of the primary amino acid sequence between different Gα subunits.
- The goal of creating Gα chimera strains is to study the function and regulation of G protein signaling pathways. By swapping specific regions of the Gα subunits, researchers can investigate the role of individual domains in receptor binding, GTP hydrolysis, and effector activation.
- For example, a common approach to creating Gα chimera strains involves swapping the C-terminal region of one Gα subunit with that of another Gα subunit. This region is responsible for binding to downstream effectors, and by swapping it, researchers can investigate which specific downstream effectors are activated by a particular G protein.
- Gα chimera strains have been used to study a variety of signaling pathways, including those involving G protein-coupled receptors ([[GPCRs]]), ion channels, and non-receptor proteins. They have also been used to investigate the mechanisms of various diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurological disorders.
