- Luminal acidification refers to the process of lowering the pH (increasing the acidity) of the contents within a particular compartment or space inside the body, called the lumen. The lumen refers to the interior space within a tubular structure or organ, such as the stomach or the urinary tract.
- In the stomach, luminal acidification is an important function that is carried out by parietal cells. These cells secrete hydrochloric acid into the lumen of the stomach, which lowers the pH and helps to break down food into smaller molecules that can be easily absorbed by the body.
- Luminal acidification is also important in the urinary tract, where it helps to prevent the growth of bacteria and the formation of crystals that can lead to kidney stones. The kidneys use specialized cells called intercalated cells to regulate the pH of the urine and maintain an acidic environment within the lumen of the urinary tract.
