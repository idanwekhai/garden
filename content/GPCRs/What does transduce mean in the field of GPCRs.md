- In the field of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), transduce refers to the process by which a GPCR converts an extracellular signal (such as the binding of a ligand) into an intracellular signal (such as the activation of a G protein).
- When a ligand binds to a GPCR, it induces a conformational change in the receptor that allows it to interact with a G protein. The G protein then becomes activated and can interact with downstream effector proteins to initiate a signaling cascade that ultimately leads to a cellular response.
- The process of transduction can be modulated by various factors, including the concentration of the ligand, the expression level of the receptor and G protein, and the presence of other signaling molecules. Dysregulation of GPCR signaling can contribute to the development of various diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurological disorders.
