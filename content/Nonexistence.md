You didn't ask to exist, but now you exist and then you can't stand the thought of non-existence.  
  
We get so used to the idea of existence, that we form myths about an afterlife, a place where you can exist forever. Humans who are always keen on creating a binary tell us that your eternal existence can either be pleasure/paradise or pain, based on how you behave on earth.  
  
Some go ahead to indoctrinate you into their supposed good ways so you can experience "eternal paradise" with them. Some others live their own life being judgmental about people and measure their own value and respect for others based on how inclined these "others" are to their own idea of "good ways"
